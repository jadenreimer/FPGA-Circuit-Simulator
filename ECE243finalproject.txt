ECE 243 Final Project
=====================

Project due on April 3rd, but we can still hand it in until the following week

We have selected option 2:

"Create a new animation of your choosing. For example, create a game of some sort. Again, the amount of work required should be at least as much as that needed for Lab Exercise 7"

Our Proposal:
-------------

- Create a 2D scrolling video game that displays to the VGA display and uses the FPGA
- The user of said game will be tasked with scoring as many points as possible
- Points are accumulated automatically over time, therefore the user's primary task will be to "survive" as long as possible
- The user will attempt to control the jumping motion of a small square
- The user's square will appear stationary on the left side of the screen, and obstacle squares will approach it from the right at a constant
- To continue his/her session, the user must use the jumping action of their square to avoid the obstacle squares
- A user's session is terminated (the user "dies") when their square contacts an obstacle square
- The user's score will stop increasing and their screen will display a message, indicating their loss, and their score
- The user can "jump" with the square again to reset their score and try again

Possible Next Steps:
--------------------

1. Have the square's jumping action be controlled from the keyboard, rather than the FPGA
2. Change the shape of the user's playable object from a square to another object or thing
3. Change the shape of the obstacles from a square to another object
4. Have the game's speed slowly increase over time, to create difficulty for the user
5. Have the jumping animation be changed to something more realistic
6. Have the user's score displayed onscreen
7. Have the game output sound

# 243-project

Path to develop program:
1. Get box and line drawing working
2. Get image displaying working (there was some preliminary code about this given by one of the TAs, shouldn't be more complicated than "clearing" the screen with pixels taken from a file)
3. Get the box jumping with key presses
4. Get the background moving behind the box
5. Get obstacles flying toward the box from the right
6. Get hitboxes working with the box and obstacles
7. Scale the speed of the game with a computed score
8. Get a restart button
